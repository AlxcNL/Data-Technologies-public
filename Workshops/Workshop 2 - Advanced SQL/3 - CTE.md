# Common Table Expressions

Common Table Expressions (CTEs), introduced using the `WITH` clause, are a powerful feature in SQL that improve query structure, readability, and performance. CTEs allow temporary result sets to be referenced multiple times within a query, making them useful for **breaking down complex queries**, handling **recursive operations**, and improving **maintainability**.

&nbsp;

A **Common Table Expression (CTE)** is essentially a temporary named result set that exists for the duration of a query.

## Basic syntax

````sql
WITH cte_name AS (
    SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE condition
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
````

CTEs provide a **cleaner alternative** to subqueries, improving readability and reusability.

## Benefits of Using CTEs

- **Improves Readability**: Simplifies complex queries by breaking them into logical parts.
- **Enhances Performance**: Reduces redundant calculations by reusing temporary results.
- **Supports Recursion**: Enables hierarchical queries, such as organizational structures.

### Simple data extraction
Let's learn by example. We will retrieve all students enrolled in courses.

````sql
WITH enrolled_students AS (
    SELECT student_id, course_id, academic_year FROM enrollments
)
SELECT * FROM enrolled_students WHERE academic_year = 2025;
````

&nbsp;

### Using CTEs for Aggregation
Finding the average course credits per department:

```sql
WITH department_credits AS (
    SELECT department, AVG(credits) AS avg_credits
    FROM courses
    GROUP BY department
)
SELECT * FROM department_credits;
```

&nbsp;

### Multiple CTEs in one query
CTEs can also be **stacked**, allowing independent calculations.

````sql
WITH active_courses AS (
    SELECT id, name FROM courses WHERE active = true
), 
recent_enrollments AS (
    SELECT student_id, course_id FROM enrollments WHERE academic_year = 2024
)
SELECT * FROM active_courses ac 
JOIN recent_enrollments re ON ac.id = re.course_id;
````

&nbsp;

## Recursive CTEs for hierarchical data

Recursive queries are particularly useful for **organizational hierarchies**, **course prerequisites**, and **nested relationships**.

The original university dataset does not include a table for course prerequisites.
For this example, we extend the database with a new table: ```course_dependencies```, which stores prerequisite relationships between courses.

Before running the query below, execute the script to create and populate this table:\
[University Course prerequisites](data/course_prerequisites.sql)

What if we need to find course prerequisites recursively? We could use:

````sql
WITH RECURSIVE course_tree AS (
    -- Anchor query: Start with the target course
    SELECT course_id, prerequisite_id, 1 AS level FROM course_dependencies WHERE course_id = 76
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive query: Find dependencies of prerequisites
    SELECT cd.course_id, cd.prerequisite_id, ct.level + 1 
    FROM course_dependencies cd
    JOIN course_tree ct ON cd.course_id = ct.prerequisite_id
)
SELECT * FROM course_tree;
````
The anchor query defines the starting set of rows.\
The recursive query repeatedly builds on the previous result by joining with the CTE itself.\
The recursion stops implicitly when no new rows are produced.

&nbsp;

### Define a view from this recursive CTE

When we make the CTE more generic by factoring out the specific target course we can create a view from it.

```sql
CREATE VIEW course_hierarchy as  (
    WITH RECURSIVE course_tree AS (
        
    -- anchor: start for every course as root
    SELECT course_id AS root_course_id, course_id, prerequisite_id, 1 AS level
    FROM course_dependencies

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive query
    SELECT ct.root_course_id, cd.course_id, cd.prerequisite_id, ct.level + 1
    FROM course_dependencies cd
    JOIN course_tree ct ON cd.course_id = ct.prerequisite_id
    )
    SELECT * FROM course_tree
);

```
The view can be queried as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM course_hierarchy
WHERE root_course_id = 76;
```

## Aggregation & Statistical Computations

What if we want to calculate the average grade per student using CTEs for a cleaner logic, we could use:

````sql
WITH student_grades AS (
    SELECT enrollment_id, AVG(grade) AS avg_grade FROM results GROUP BY enrollment_id
)
SELECT * FROM student_grades WHERE avg_grade > 3.0;
````
