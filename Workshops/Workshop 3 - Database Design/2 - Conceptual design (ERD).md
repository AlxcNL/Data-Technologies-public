# Conceptual Design – Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

What is an ERD? Understanding entities, relationships, and attributes.

Identifying primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

Types of relationships:
- One-to-One (1:1)
- One-to-Many (1:N)
- Many-to-Many (M:N)

Drawing ERDs manually vs. using tools (Mermaid, DBML, Draw.io, SQLDBM).
